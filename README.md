Odin Recipes Project

This is my first project in TOP's curriculum! This project will exercise my recently acquired html knowledge as I build a basic recipe website with only html.
The website consists of a main index page with links to some cool recipes. Some knowledge I hope to use..
* html boilerplate code
* headings and paragraphs
* source comments
* strong and emphasis
* links and images
* lists (ul and ol)

Please enjoy!
